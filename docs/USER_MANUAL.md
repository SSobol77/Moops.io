## 7. Troubleshooting

If you run into problems:

* Ensure all dependencies from `requirements.txt` are installed.
* Check that all required environment variables are set (locally via `.env`, on Spaces via *Secrets*).
* Review terminal or Space logs for error messages.
* Restart the application after changing environment or configuration.
* Ensure your Python version is compatible (3.10+).
* For Gmail SMTP: enable App Passwords, use port 465, and ensure no 2FA blocks.
* For FAQ upload issues: check file encoding (UTF-8) and correct `.md` format.
* Data export errors: verify write permissions and active DB connection.
* To reset state: delete `orders.db` and restart the app (a new DB will be created).
* If the UI glitches, clear your browser cache or try another browser.
* For persistent issues, consult the community or open an issue on GitHub.
* See source code comments for customization hooks and further guidance.
